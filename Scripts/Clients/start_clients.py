def start_clients(alg, FL_ROUNDS, NUM_CLIENTS, CURRENT_CLUSTER, DRIFT):
	"""
	Start multiple client processes for federated learning.

    Args:
    - alg (str): Federated learning algorithm to be used by clients.
    - FL_ROUNDS (int): Number of federated learning rounds.
    - NUM_CLIENTS (int): Total number of clients.
    - CURRENT_CLUSTER (dict): Current cluster configuration.
    - DRIFT (bool): Whether drift detection is enabled.

    Returns:
    - None

    Description:
    This function starts multiple client processes for federated learning. It creates separate processes for each client,
    passing the required arguments to the client function. After starting all client processes, it waits for them to complete
    using the 'join' method to ensure synchronization. Finally, it sets an event to allow all processes to start at the same time.

    Steps:
    1. Create an event object for synchronization.
    2. Start a separate process for each client using the 'Process' class from the multiprocessing module.
    3. Pass the federated learning algorithm, round number, number of clients, current cluster configuration, and drift detection flag
       as arguments to each client function.
    4. Use the 'join' method to wait for all client processes to complete.
    5. Set an event to indicate that all processes are ready to start.

    Note:
    - Ensure that client functions (e.g., start_client1, start_client2, etc.) are defined and imported correctly.
    - This function assumes that client functions accept the specified arguments.
    - Clients are started in parallel to leverage multiprocessing capabilities for efficient execution.
    - The function does not return any value but starts client processes to perform federated learning tasks.
